# Data Preparation Basics
## 1. Filtering and selecting
* Introducing the pandas Library
    * Why pandas - fast data cleaning, preparaion and analysis; easy to use for data visualization and machine learning.
    * What is pandas - built on top of NumPy, makes it easy to work with arrays and matrices.
    * Indexing in pandas
        * An index is a list of integers or labels you use to uniquely identify rows or columns.
        * This course uses: 
            * A set of square-brackets `[...]`
            * the `.loc[]` indexer.
    * `DataFrame` object - acts like a spreadsheet in Excel, made of a set of `Series` objects, and are indexables.
    * `Series` object - a row or column that is indexed.

* Comparison Operators in Python

    Operator | Arithmetic Operaion
    ---------|--------------------
    == | True if values of two operands are equal
    != | True if values of two operands are unequal
    <> | True if values of two operands are unequal
    \> | True if the left operand has a value that's greater than the right operand
    < | True if the left operand has a value that's less than the right operand
    \>= | True if the left operand has a value that's greater than or equal the right operand
    <= | True if the left operand has a value that's less than or equal the right operand
* Code Demonstration
    * Plain indexing
    * Data slicing 
    * Arithmetic comparison
