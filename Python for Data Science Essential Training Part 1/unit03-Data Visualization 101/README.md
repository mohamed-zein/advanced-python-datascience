# Data Visualization 101
## 1. The three types of data visualization
* Three Different Data Visualization Types
    1. **Data storytelling** - for presentation to organizational decision makers.
    2. **Data showcasing** - for presentation to analysts, scientists, mathematicians, and engineers.
    3. **Data art** - for presentation to activists or to the general public.

### Data storytelling
* The purpose of **Data storytelling** is to make it easy for the audience to get the point.
    * You want them to understand that point within the first 10 to 15 seconds of looking at you graphic.
    * If they will have to be looking more than that, then you're going to lose their attention.
* For these reasons, your data visualization should be:
    * Clutter-free.
    * Highly focused/organized.
* Intended audience:
    * Nonanalysts.
    * Nontechnical business managers.
* Product types:
    * Static images.
    * Simple interactive dashboards.
* In this course, we are going to use Python libarary [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) to create interactive data visualization.
* Example:

    * [Data storytelling](#data-storytelling) is where you present your findings in very, very clear and easy-to-understand way.

    * Open ended:
        * Not telling the audience your findings but allowing them to think for themselves.
* Intended audience:
    * Analysts, quants.
    * Engineers, mathematicians, scientists
    * Basically people with analytical mindset, background.
* Product types:
    * Static images.
    * Interactive dashboards.
